                <strong>Tastemakers of Understated Chic Luxury</strong>
                <br />
                <br />
                Sitting atop the curvaceous cliffs of Italyâ€™s Amalfi Coast, Casa
                Angelina offers a sublime slice of modern minimalism on the
                Mediterranean, with an emphasis on barefoot luxury and top-level
                gastronomy.
                <br />
                <br />
                Our 37-room hotel serves as a sanctuary, bearing a fresh,
                white-washed aesthetic that accentuates every space, from the
                azure sea and sky outside to the contemporary artworks on
                display inside.
                <br />
                <br />
                We work to ensure everything about your stay is true perfection,
                from our welcome amenities and the thoughtful turndown services
                to the curated dishes from our chefs and activities organized by
                our concierge.
