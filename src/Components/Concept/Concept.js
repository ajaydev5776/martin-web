                        <p>It’s hard to imagine a more magically majestic location perched on the Amalfi coast’s craggy cliffs than this one. From the rooftop terrace of the hotel, the sea air skips the scent of distant lemon groves hidden between green mountains and the deep blue sea. Though it is quintessentially Italian at heart, they like to do things a little differently at their Casa. From the moment you cast your eyes on this charming hotel set high above its pretty home of Praiano, you’ll instantly see why everyone says there’s no other hotel on the Amalfi Coast quite like it. Unlike all the other grand dames hewn from the cliffs, it offers a Dolce Vita barefoot lifestyle through a refreshingly modern lens, perfect for celebrating life’s special moments. The hotel is a place to get lost in rather than a place to be seen. And that’s very much part of its quixotic appeal.</p>

                    <div>
                        <p>Local designer Marco de Luca knows how to make a statement and is the man behind the hotel’s ground-breaking, white-washed design. White-on-white dazzles and minimalist aesthetics reign supreme in practically all the lounge spaces. Here, the romance of the Amalfi Coast takes center stage. The walls are open canvases. Think fluttering curtains among pristine seascapes, white sofas and armchairs sat among a private collection of quirky and edgy art pieces, plus sculptures by Cuban artist Alfredo Sisabravo and oil paintings by Argentinian Patricia Valencia Cartsens, among other excellent artists from across the globe. It’s stylish, but in the most laid-back and luxurious way possible.</p>
